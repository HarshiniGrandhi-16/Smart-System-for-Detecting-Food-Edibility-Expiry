# üçè Smart System for Detecting Food Edibility/Expiry

## Description

The **Smart System for Detecting Food Edibility/Expiry** is a C++ application designed to address the growing concern of food wastage in households. By allowing users to input the expiry dates of food items and the current date, the system determines whether the food is still edible or has expired. This project aims to promote awareness about food freshness and reduce waste through efficient tracking of food items.

## Problem Statement

Despite the prevalence of food wastage in recent years, many households, particularly in developed countries, often neglect this issue. Studies have shown that food wastage is significantly lower in developing countries. This project aims to tackle the problem of food wastage by providing an automated system for tracking food expiration.

## Aim

To implement a code that runs a smart system for detecting whether food is edible or expired.

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Import necessary libraries (`stdio.h`, `time.h`).
3. Define constants `MAX_YEAR` (9999) and `MIN_YEAR` (1900).
4. Initialize integer variables for `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DATE` using structures (`struct`).
5. Check for leap years and non-leap years.
6. Enter the expiry date details.
7. Verify the validity of the expiry dates.
8. Check whether the expiry date is null. If it is null, return 0.
9. If the expiry details are correct, print "Product date has not expired."
10. Else, print "Product has expired."
11. Stop the program.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, the C++ program successfully checks whether a food item is edible or expired by taking inputs such as the year, month, and date of manufacture. This input allows users to determine the freshness of their food items effectively.
